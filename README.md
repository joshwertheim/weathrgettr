# weathrgettr

Fun little command-line utility that uses the Wunderground API. Currently prints a very short current weather summary for San Jose, CA. 

Planning to add custom location tracking and three-day forecasts.

NOTE: To use this utility, you will need your own API key from Wunderground. Once you obtain one, simply create a prefs.txt file in the resources folder with the following structure:

```
[API]
api_key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
